    ROTATION
        Alpha is calculated as the initial angle plus the rotation rate

    LOAD_FACTOR
        Alpha is limited to ensure the load factor never exceeds a

        Alpha is calculated to set a particular floor angle given the
        current flight path angle.
    DECELERATION
        Alpha is calculated to target a specified TAS rate, the default
        is a TAS rate of 0 (Constant TAS).

        Alpha is calculated such that the aircraft produces a particular
        lifting force.
    ALTITUDE_RATE
        Alpha is calculated to target a specified altitude rate, the default
        is 0 (Constant Altitude).
