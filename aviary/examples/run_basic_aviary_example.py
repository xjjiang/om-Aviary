"""
This is a straightforward and basic example of running a coupled aircraft design-mission optimization in Aviary.
This uses the "level 1" API within Aviary.

We use the pre-defined single aisle commercial transport aircraft definition and use a pre-defined phase_info object
to describe the mission optimization problem to Aviary.
This mission consists of climb, cruise, and descent phases.
We then call the `setup_and_run_aviary` function, which takes in the path to the aircraft model, the phase info, and some other options.
This performs a coupled design-mission optimization and outputs the results from Aviary into the `reports` folder.
